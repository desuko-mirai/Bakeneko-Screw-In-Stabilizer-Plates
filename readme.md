# Screw-In Stabilizer Plates for Bakeneko Keyboards

The Bakeneko 60 and 65 keyboards designed by kkatano have become well-known in the community and are loved by many, however some people take issue with being forced to use clip-in stabilizers. This collection of plates features cutouts above the stabilizers, as seen on Bakeneko-derived boards such as the Phantom by Maker Keyboards and Block-67 by ENG Studio, allowing the o-ring to sit above the stabilizers and eliminating the issue of interference.

## Layout and Keyboard Support

The **Bakeneko 60 V3** plate supports all layouts supported by the [Bakeneko 60 V3 PCB](https://github.com/kkatano/bakeneko-60). It can be used in the Bakeneko 60 V3, Cannon Keys Bakeneko 60, Ciel[^confirm], and Unikorn[^confirm].

The **Bakeneko 65 V3** plate supports all layouts supported by the [Bakeneko 65 V3 PCB](https://github.com/kkatano/bakeneko-65). It can be used in the Bakeneko 65 V3, Cannon Keys Bakeneko 65, Block-67, Phantom, and Portal[^confirm].

Either plate should also work with any keyboard derived from the Bakeneko design.

[^confirm]: Compatibility with these boards is not confirmed, but they are based on the Bakeneko design (except the Unikorn, on which the Bakeneko is based) and so in theory are compatible.
